# About Me

ðŸš€ Country Manager | 3D & CAD Veteran | BIM + AI Enthusiast
ðŸŽ¨ Artist | Watercolor & Oil | Creative problem-solver

With over 30 years of experience in CAD, BIM, and engineering software for the Oil & Gas, Construction, and Manufacturing sectors, I bridge the gap between technical precision and creative thinking. My journey started with a background in management and a passion for designâ€”and along the way, I picked up programming (AutoLISP, VBA, Python, JavaScript) to build smart tools that solve real-world problems.

I'm currently working on a SaaS app that leverages BIM and AI to modernize the construction industry. Always open to collaboration and learning from othersâ€”especially if you're passionate about tech with impact.

On the side, Iâ€™m a watercolor and oil painter. I love the contrast: the spontaneity of watercolor and the depth of oil. Much like how I approach techâ€”ready to improvise, or go deep when needed.

Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and create something meaningful.
